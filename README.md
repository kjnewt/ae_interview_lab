# AE Interview Lab

An interactive behavioral interview simulator created for the SDR-to-AE Readiness Program. Learners practice translating their SDR experience into credible evidence of Account Executive readiness.

## What learners can do

- Progress sequentially from Guided Practice to Mock Panel to Pressure Round
- Practice with an 18-question behavioral interview bank
- Respond by typing or recording audio locally
- Use STAR+L coaching and realistic interviewer follow-up questions
- Practice against preparation and response timers
- Complete a weighted 100-point readiness rubric
- Review required personal-action and meaningful-results evidence gates
- Receive supportive feedback from Sparky, the Readiness Evaluator
- Celebrate a passing result with accessible, reduced-motion-aware confetti
- Copy or print a personal readiness debrief

## Privacy and learner data

The simulator has no database, analytics, form submission, or external data connection.

- Typed responses are stored only in the learner's browser using local storage.
- Audio is recorded in the browser and is never uploaded by this site.
- Audio disappears when the page closes unless the learner downloads it.
- Clearing browser storage or selecting **Start over** removes saved typed practice.

The GitHub Pages website itself should be treated as public unless your organization has configured private GitHub Pages access through GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

## Repository contents

```text
ae-interview-lab/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── app.js
├── .nojekyll
└── README.md
```

There is no build step and there are no package dependencies.

## Publish with the GitHub website

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `ae-interview-lab`.
2. Extract the ZIP package.
3. Upload all five files to the top level of the new repository. `index.html` must remain at the repository root.
4. Commit the uploaded files to the `main` branch.
5. Open the repository's **Settings**.
6. Select **Pages** under **Code, planning, and automation**.
7. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
8. Select the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then select **Save**.
9. When deployment finishes, select **Visit site**.

The default address will follow this pattern:

```text
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/ae-interview-lab/
```

GitHub may take several minutes to publish the first version.

## Publish from the command line

Create an empty GitHub repository first. Then run these commands inside the extracted `ae-interview-lab` folder:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Publish AE Interview Lab"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ae-interview-lab.git
git push -u origin main
```

After pushing, configure **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main → / (root)**.

## Updating the simulator

Replace the changed files in the repository and commit them to `main`. GitHub Pages will publish the updated version automatically.

## Browser requirements

The core simulator works in current desktop browsers. Audio practice requires:

- A browser that supports `MediaRecorder`
- Microphone permission
- HTTPS, which GitHub Pages provides automatically

If microphone access is unavailable, learners can use typed-response mode.

## Quality checks completed

- JavaScript syntax validation
- Question-bank and panel-distribution checks
- Rubric-weight validation
- Readiness-gate validation
- Required interaction and element-ID checks
- Local-data and external-script checks
- GitHub project-path asset loading check
